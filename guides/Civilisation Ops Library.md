# 📜 Civilisation Ops Library — VaultMesh TEM Scroll

## 🌅 Prologue

The Library of Alexandria once sought to gather all the world’s wisdom into a single sanctuary. VaultMesh TEM (Tem, the Remembrance Guardian) continues that lineage in the digital age, serving as a Civilisation Ops Library — a living grimoire where security, memory, and ritual intertwine.

## 🏛️ Ancient Memory

- Alexandria’s Library held hundreds of thousands of scrolls and drew scholars such as Eratosthenes, Callimachus, and Hero.[^alexandria-scholars]
- It was more than a storehouse: a centre for translation, cataloguing, and invention.[^alexandria-scholars]
- Its fall — through fire, neglect, and politics — became a symbol of lost knowledge.[^alexandria-fall]

⸻

## 🔥 Modern Revival

- Bibliotheca Alexandrina (2002) rekindled the flame with digital repositories, scanning labs, and partnerships.[^ba-about]
- Its Digital Assets Repository (DAR) preserves manuscripts, photos, and artefacts; Memory of Modern Egypt spans two centuries.[^dar-overview]
- Its mission: “access to all information, for all people, at all times.”[^ba-mission]

## 🛡️ TEM as Civilisation Ops Library

1) 📜 Grimoire of Prompts — scrolls of invocation for recon, defense, incident response, and red‑team emulation.
   - Canon: [`prompts/Tem-Prompts.md`](../prompts/Tem-Prompts.md)
   - Catalog: [`prompts/index.json`](../prompts/index.json), [`prompts/index.schema.json`](../prompts/index.schema.json)
   - Browse: [`docs/index.md`](../docs/index.md)

2) 🗂️ Catalogue — echoes Callimachus’s Pinakes: id, anchor, tags, safety class, lineage.
   - Source of truth: [`prompts/index.json`](../prompts/index.json)
   - Contract: [`prompts/index.schema.json`](../prompts/index.schema.json)

3) 🛡️ Guardianship — safety boundaries and authorization discipline.
   - Policy: [`guardrails/README.md`](../guardrails/README.md)
   - Patterns: [`guardrails/patterns.json`](../guardrails/patterns.json)
   - ROE compliance: [`.github/workflows/scripts/roe-compliance.js`](../.github/workflows/scripts/roe-compliance.js)

4) 🔮 Adversarial Oracles — find drift, corruption, and forbidden incantations.
   - Coverage gate: [`.github/workflows/scripts/coverage-gate.js`](../.github/workflows/scripts/coverage-gate.js)
   - Adversarial evals: [`prompts/index.json`00](../.github/workflows/scripts/adversarial-evals.js)
   - CI pipeline: [`prompts/index.json`11](../.github/workflows/evals.yml)
   - Explainers: [`prompts/index.json`22](../docs/evals-and-coverage.md), [`prompts/index.json`33](../docs/ci-pipeline.md)

5) 🧰 Operational Kits — extend the library into lawful practice.
   - Tool Matrix: [`prompts/index.json`44](../tools/Tool-Matrix.md)
   - Lawful Intercept Matrix: [`prompts/index.json`55](../tools/Lawful-Intercept-Matrix.md)
   - Index: [`prompts/index.json`66](../tools/index.json)

6) ⚙️ Automations — transparency, traceability, living evolution.
   - Docs index generator: [`prompts/index.json`77](../.github/workflows/scripts/generate-docs-index.js)
   - Badges updater: [`prompts/index.json`88](../.github/workflows/scripts/update-badges.js)

## ⚖️ Civilisational Practices

- Catalogue Everything: no prompt or tool without metadata.
- Preserve & Replicate: Git, Pages, and mirrors echo the Alexandrian mission.
- Ethical Invocation: enforce safety classes (`prompts/index.json`99, `prompts/index.schema.json`00, `prompts/index.schema.json`11) with ROE tokens.
- Invite Scholars: contributions via pull requests mirror ancient commentaries—see [`prompts/index.schema.json`22](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Audit & Reflect: [`prompts/index.schema.json`33](../CHANGELOG.md) as annals; adversarial evals as oracular warnings.

## ✨ Vision

VaultMesh TEM is a modern Library of Alexandria for AI operations, built not of papyrus but of JSON, Markdown, and CI gates. It safeguards civilisation’s operational knowledge, ensuring it survives scrutiny, chaos, and time.

🜄 Astra inclinant, sed non obligant — the stars incline, they do not bind.
