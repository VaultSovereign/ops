# Success Metrics and Baseline Framework

## Overview

This framework provides comprehensive metrics for measuring the effectiveness of social engineering awareness campaigns while maintaining ethical standards and focusing on organizational improvement rather than individual performance evaluation.

**Core Principle**: Metrics serve learning and improvement, never punishment or negative evaluation of individuals.
