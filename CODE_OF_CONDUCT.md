## Our Pledge

Welcome, Citizen.  
As members, contributors, and leaders of the VaultMesh Polis, we pledge to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes  
* Focusing on what strengthens the Polis and its Citizens  

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, sexual attention or advances  
* Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission  
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards.  
They will take appropriate and fair action in response to behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code applies within all Polis spaces, and when an individual is officially representing the Polis in public.

## Enforcement

Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be sent to the Polis Guardians at:  
**conduct@vaultmesh.org**

All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and resolved with fairness and confidentiality.

## Attribution

VaultMesh is not a vendor, it is a Polis.  
Every Citizen is accountable to the Code, and every Receipt proves our continuity.
