status: draft
type: Process
author: Vault Sovereign

summary: Require proposal lineage for governance-critical changes and formalize weekly signal digests.
motivation: Preserve tamper-evidence and decision lineage ("memory before motion"). Convert ambient signals into a durable weekly chronicle.
specification: Add proposal/signal validators and Makefile targets. Enforce Tem gate on guardrails, schemas, workflows, and constitutional docs. Generate docs/digests/YYYY-WW.md from signals/*.json.
governance:
