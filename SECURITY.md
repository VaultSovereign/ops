# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We encourage responsible disclosure.

Please include:
- Affected file(s) and section anchor(s)
- Description of impact and risk
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Any PoC should be pseudocode only; no weaponized payloads

Disclosure policy:
- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- Provide status update within 7 business days
- Target fix/mitigation window: 90 days (or mutually agreed)

Out of scope:
- Social engineering of maintainers
- Findings that require violating terms of service or law

## Coordinated Disclosure
We collaborate with reporters to coordinate public disclosure. We will reference CVEs/KEV where applicable and credit reporters who request it.
