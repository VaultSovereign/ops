# Ops Vault

This vault keeps two pillars in sync:

- `[[Prompts/README]]` — reusable prompt components, personas, and workflows.
- `[[Runbooks/README]]` — operational procedures for daily work and incidents.

Get started:
1. Read `[[Guides/Working With This Vault]]` for a quick orientation.
2. Use the scripts in `Scripts/` to bootstrap new notes from templates.
3. Tag notes and stitch them together with links so related prompts and runbooks stay discoverable.

Need inspiration? Check `[[Prompts/Foundations/Prompt Patterns]]` and the sample runbooks under `[[Runbooks/]]`.
