# Prompt Library

This space stores reusable prompts and prompt assets you can remix for different tools.

- `Foundations/` holds building blocks such as meta-prompts, tone guidelines, and modifiers.
- `Personas/` contains ready-to-use system prompts and role definitions for different assistants.
- `Workflows/` gives you multi-step prompt sequences for complex tasks.

Add a new prompt by creating a file under the appropriate folder. Use the templates in `Templates/` to stay consistent.
