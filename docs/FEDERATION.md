# Federation (Draft)

Purpose: Define membership, trust, replication, and dispute resolution for multi‑node operation.

## Membership
- Identity: verified keys, claims, and proofs
- Admission: proposal → review → consensus threshold

## Trust & Replication
- Data: CRDT/merkle sync; provenance preserved
- Policy: guardrail set negotiated per member; lowest common denominator enforcement

## Disputes
- Evidence submission → mediation queue → quorum decision
- Receipts & seals logged; reversible only via counter‑receipts
