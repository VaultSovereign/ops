# VaultMesh Governance Analysis

## Scope & Approach

- Analyze VaultMesh within DAO governance, civilization‑as‑code, and Earth’s leadership.
- Method: map repository artifacts to governance primitives, identify gaps, and propose next steps.

## Repo Artifact Map → Governance Primitives

- Councils/Temporal Cadence: guides/runbooks for weekly/monthly/yearly reviews (temporal governance).
- Receipts/Audit Trails: CI artifacts (`eval-results/*`), CHANGELOG, and commit history as tamper‑evident traces.
- Guardrails/Policies: `guardrails/` patterns, thresholds, allowlists + CI gates as enforceable policy.
- Catalogs/Indexes: `prompts/index.json`, `tools/index.json` as API contracts; schemas ensure integrity.
- Authority & Process: `CODEOWNERS`, PR template, `SECURITY.md` define roles, review, and disclosure.

## Gaps vs DAO Primitives

- Proposals: no canonical proposal object/schema.
- Voting: no standardized voting workflows or tallying.
- Execution: CI enforces policy but isn’t linked to proposal→vote→execute lifecycle.
- Treasury: philosophy exists; no concrete in‑repo ledger specification.

## Civilization‑as‑Code Notes

- Temporal layers (weekly/monthly/yearly) mirror governance epochs; keep them explicit in docs.
- Treat catalogs and guardrails as constitutional artifacts; CI acts as enforcement.
- Maintain separation: culture in docs; enforcement in gates.

## Next Steps (Actionable)

1. Signals System: add `docs/SIGNALS.md` with weighted scoring, epochs, and sigil anchors; provide JSON schema.
1. Federation: `docs/FEDERATION.md` covering membership, trust, replication, and dispute resolution.
1. Leadership: `docs/LEADERSHIP.md` defining roles, selection, term limits, and recall.
1. Crisis Protocols: `docs/CRISIS.md` with severities, activation criteria, and comms playbooks.
1. DAO Primitives: introduce `proposals/` (YAML/JSON + schema) and link PRs that modify governance‑critical files.
