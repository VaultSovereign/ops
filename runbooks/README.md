# Runbook Library

Runbooks capture repeatable procedures and troubleshooting guides. Organize them by domain or service inside the subfolders.

Suggested structure:

- `Operations/` for day-to-day recurring tasks.
- `Incidents/` for emergency response and recovery flows.

Each runbook should start from the template in `Templates/Runbook Template.md` so steps and ownership stay consistent.
