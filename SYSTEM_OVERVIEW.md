# Social Engineering Strategist - System Overview

## üéØ Purpose
A comprehensive tool for planning ethical awareness campaigns and simulations with clear consent boundaries. This system helps security teams create educational social engineering simulations that focus on learning rather than punishment, while maintaining strict safety and ethical guidelines.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Main Strategist** (`social_engineering_strategist.py`)
   - Central orchestrator for campaign creation
   - Input validation and safety compliance
   - Campaign planning and management

2. **Training Module Templates** (`training_module_templates.py`)
   - Pre-built training content for different scenarios
   - Audience-specific content (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - Multiple formats (interactive, presentation, simulation, assessment)

3. **Simulation Scenarios** (`simulation_scenarios.py`)
   - Library of ethical simulation scenarios
   - Phishing, vishing, physical security, pretexting, baiting
   - Difficulty levels and safety controls

4. **Success Metrics Framework** (`success_metrics.py`)
   - Comprehensive metrics tracking
   - Progress monitoring and reporting
   - Trend analysis and recommendations

5. **Debrief Materials Generator** (`debrief_materials.py`)
   - Structured debrief sessions
   - Learning outcome tracking
   - Follow-up action planning

6. **Safety Guardrails** (`safety_guardrails.py`)
   - Consent management and validation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Approval workflows and incident tracking

## üöÄ Key Features

### Safety and Ethics
- **Explicit Consent**: Required for all activities with clear opt-out mechanisms
- **Harm Prevention**: No actual harm or damage to participants or systems
- **Privacy Protection**: Data anonymization and secure handling
- **Transparency**: Clear identification of simulations and educational purpose

### Campaign Management
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all required parameters are provided
- **Audience Assessment**: Automatically determines appropriate content level
- **Channel Selection**: Supports email, chat, phone, and in-person channels
- **Safety Compliance**: Built-in safety checks and approval workflows

### Training and Simulation
- **Audience-Specific Content**: Tailored to different skill levels
- **Multiple Formats**: Interactive, presentation, simulation, and assessment modules
- **Educational Focus**: Scenarios designed for learning, not punishment
- **Comprehensive Scenarios**: Phishing, vishing, physical security, and more

### Metrics and Measurement
- **Awareness Metrics**: Phishing recognition, social engineering awareness
- **Behavior Metrics**: Verification compliance, incident reporting rates
- **Training Metrics**: Completion rates, effectiveness scores
- **Culture Metrics**: Security culture index, peer reporting confidence

## üìä Usage Examples

### Basic Campaign Creation
```python
from social_engineering_strategist import SocialEngineeringStrategist, CampaignInputs, Channel, RulesOfEngagement

strategist = SocialEngineeringStrategist()

inputs = CampaignInputs(
    objective="Improve phishing awareness among all employees",
    audience="all employees",
    channels=[Channel.EMAIL],
    rules_of_engagement=[RulesOfEngagement.CONSENT, RulesOfEngagement.OPT_OUT]
)

campaign = strategist.create_campaign(inputs)
```

### Safety-Controlled Campaign
```python
from safety_guardrails import SafetyGuardrails

guardrails = SafetyGuardrails()

# Request consent
consent_id = guardrails.request_consent(
    participant_id="user_001",
    participant_name="Alice Johnson",
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    consent_type="phishing_simulation"
)

guardrails.grant_consent(consent_id)

# Conduct safety assessment
assessment = guardrails.conduct_safety_assessment(
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    activity_type="phishing_simulation",
    risk_factors=["email_simulations", "data_collection"]
)
```

### Metrics Tracking
```python
from success_metrics import SuccessMetricsFramework

metrics = SuccessMetricsFramework()

# Create campaign metrics
campaign_metrics = metrics.create_campaign_metrics(
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    campaign_name="Security Awareness Campaign",
    start_date=datetime.datetime.now()
)

# Add measurements
metrics.add_measurement(
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    metric_name="phishing_recognition_rate",
    value=75.0,
    measurement_date=datetime.datetime.now(),
    confidence_level=0.95,
    sample_size=100
)

# Calculate progress
progress = metrics.calculate_campaign_progress("campaign_001")
```
